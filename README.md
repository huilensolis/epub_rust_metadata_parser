# Epub rust metadata parser
this is a mockup metadata parser written in rust. this is made with he intention of playing with the epub folder format, exploring and testing how to unzip an epub file, read its container.xml, get the path to the contents file, and read it to extract the metadata and paths to each section of the book.

this is extremely ineffective and may not always work, but doesnt matter, because it's purpose is to be a mock-up of a polished future version written in typescript
